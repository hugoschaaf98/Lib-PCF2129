# Tiny driver for PCF2129 RTC

This library aims to drive the PCF2129 RTC via IÂ²C interface. You can easily port the library to the platform of your choice
by re-implementing the functions located in `twi_wrapper.hpp`. The current implementation is designed to be used with the Arduino framework.
The library comments are *Doxygen* formatted so please find the full documentation in these comments.

###### TODO

There is still a lot of work to do to benefit from the full functionnalities of the RTC. However the "essential" functionnalities
are already implemented.

If you want to contribute to this little project, I've put everything in the comments to let you know what are the todo's and 
even in some cases how it would be great to do it :)
